# futracer

Race through breathtaking 3-D graphics with Futhark!

Run `make` to build the library, and then run `./futracer.py` to run the
program.

Not quite finished.  Also pretty slow, and probably not getting any
faster.


## Dependencies

`futracer.py` depends on the programming language Futhark;
see [http://futhark-lang.org/](http://futhark-lang.org/)
and
[https://github.com/HIPERFIT/futhark](https://github.com/HIPERFIT/futhark).

`futracer.py` also depends on PyGame and NumPy.


## Keyboard controls

Use the arrow keys for now.
